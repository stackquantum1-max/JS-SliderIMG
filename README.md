Image Slider Project

A clean, responsive image slider built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, smooth CSS transitions, and dynamic image rotation.

Two-Slide Carousel: Shows two images side-by-side with smooth transition animations.

Navigation Buttons: Move images left or right using intuitive prev/next buttons.

Infinite Rotation: Images rotate seamlessly; no image is ever repeated until all are cycled.

Smooth Animations: Sliding animations provide a polished and professional feel.

Data Attributes for JS Targeting: Easy DOM selection using clean data-attribute naming.


Technologies Used

HTML5: Semantic structure with slides container and navigation elements.

CSS3: Flexbox layout, transitions, and transformations for smooth animations.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Array handling, event listeners, dynamic DOM updates, and wrap-around logic.
