## Image Slider Project

A sleek, responsive, and dynamic image slider built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, smooth transitions, and interactive UI design. Perfect for learning how to create rotating sliders and engaging visual layouts for web pages.


##🔹 Features

Dual-image slider: Displays two images at a time with left/right navigation.

Infinite rotation: Images continuously loop without running out.

Smooth animations: Sliding transitions for seamless user experience.

Responsive design: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Clean UI: Minimal and visually appealing layout.


##🔹 Technologies Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.

CSS3 – Flexbox, transitions, transforms, and responsive styling.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – DOM manipulation, event listeners, and dynamic image handling.


##🔹 How It Works

Image Array: All image URLs are stored in a JavaScript array.

DOM Elements: Left and right slides are targeted using querySelector.

Navigation Buttons: Clicking "Next" or "Previous" updates the slides.

Index Logic: currentIndex and nextIndex track the current images.

Smooth Transitions: CSS transition and transform provide sliding animation.
